Planet Description: Fifth planet from the sun. As the largest planet within the 
Solar System, Jupiter has served as a hypothetical bouncer regulating the movement 
of large bodies through the system while also reducing the number of harmful 
asteroids/meteorites coming with a potential path to Earth. Its largest hurricane, known as the 
"Great Red Spot" is the largest in the system with capacity to fit two Earths.
